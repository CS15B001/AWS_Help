Step 1: Choose ami-43949554 to launch an instance with CUDA installed. Region has to be N.Virginia.

Step 2: Choose request-spot when launching instance. Make sure that availibility zone (subnet) is selected properly, i.e., if us-east-d has the lowest price, choose that subnet

Step 3: Associate with one of the key pairs and preferably place it in the /home/ameet/.ssh/ folder and launch a session from there

Step 4: chmod 600 keypair.pem. Change the permissions so that the key pair is secure. The default permissions might be 777

Step 5: TROUBLESHOOT - Sometimes "Connection timed out" error keeps coming even after multiple tries. Try rebooting the instance and connect again. Make sure you go the Instances tab and then check if the launch command (ssh ****) has changed. Username might either be ec2-user or ubuntu
