Step 1: Attach the volume using the Console. Just 1 click

Step 2: lsblk - Displays the device name that was just added

Caution::::
Step 3: sudo mkfs -t ext4 device_name - Run this only if the volume is being used for the first time
device_name is /dev/"name_from_step_2"

Step 4: sudo mkdir mount_point

Step 5: sudo mount device_name mount_point

Step 6: scp -i mypermission.pem /path_to_file ubuntu@ec2-54-210-250-96.compute-1.amazonaws.com:~
Note that the user should not be ubuntu@ip_*** but the above
Note that when I tried doing scp to mount_point, it gave permission denied. scp to the root directory and then move it to mount_point. The permission problem is mostly related to sudo

Step 7: Unmount the volume before terminating the spot instance
umount -d /dev/"name_from_step_2"

Step 8: Go to the volumes section in the AWS console and detach the volume
https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-east-1#Volumes:sort=desc:createTime


Notes: Observed that all commands in mount_point, like mkdir, tar -xvzf needed sudo permissions
